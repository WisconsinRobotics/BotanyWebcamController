# BotanyWebcamController
The Botany Webcam Controller is part of a joint project with the Wisconsin
Institute for Discovery to document the growth of sprouted seeds. The
contribution of Wisconsin Robotics is two pieces of software, this program
that controls webcams programmatically and the Botany EV3 Controller that
controls the mobile platform that the webcams are mounted on.

The Botany Webcam Controller is hardcoded to the hardware configuration
provided by the WID, as such if one wishes to use a different camera or
capture images at a different resolution or file format one will need to make
modifications to the source code. Nevertheless we believe that it has value as
a relatively complete example of how to use the Microsoft Media Foundation and
the Windows Imaging Component to take photos from a webcam. This seemingly
simple operation actually requires a significant amount of infrastructure to
perform.
